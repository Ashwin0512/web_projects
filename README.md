Also, I have experience of ReactJS and NextJS as well but I don't have any project to show over there since the work I have done in both the frameworks is for ECell BPHC, and I can't share the code for the same. In this project I worked upon the About Page of the website and styling of other pages as well. 


Also, I have made a prototype website for the Wall Street as asked in the tasks. Please find the directory WSC for the same. It is also deployed on GH Pages at:
